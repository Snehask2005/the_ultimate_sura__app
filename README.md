# The Ultimate Sura App üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: George & Benny


### Team Members
- Team Lead: S K Sneha - TKM College of Engineering
- Member 2: Shikha Rajeev - TKM College of Engineering

### Project Description
An interactive website that celebrates the legend of Sura through memes, interactive tools, and playful features.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sura memes are buried under piles of random reels and meme pages. Finding them is like searching for gold in a haystack. It‚Äôs an emotional struggle.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made The Ultimate Sura App ‚Äì your one-stop shrine for Sura memes. From carefully handpicked memes to Sura-style monthly predictions, a sarcastic chatbot, and even a forehead-flicker Sura selector.
Simple. Fun. Pure Sura.
